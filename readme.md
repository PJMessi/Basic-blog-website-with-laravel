# Blog Website
This is my very first decent project in Laravel that i made years ago. It is a blog website. One can create their own account in this website and post their own blog. They can also browse and read other users' blogs. 

User can write their blogs through CKeditor textarea, where they can insert texts, lists, images and all kinds of stuffs. They can also edit or delete their previous blogs.

2. Run:  ***composer  install***
3. Create a database and edit ***'.env'*** file accordingly
4. Run: ***php artisan migrate***
5. Run: ***php artisan serve***
